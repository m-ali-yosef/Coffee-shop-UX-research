Drinks ordering online have become a trend. Our market research shows that there are
most of the students are drink coffee and other drinks in In our Arab society and 5/10 of
them are ordering coffee online via different applications. Our team is interested in
creating a digital product (mobile app) for adult students who order drinks online in their
break time to continue learning. Since adult students usually have a busy schedule, our
platform aims to speed up the orders for busy adult students.

Our team wants to learn about how adult learners use digital tools to order drinks online,
including what goals they try to achieve when using these tools. We want to determine
what opportunities and needs might exist for new drinking-order products so that we can
